# Ansible AWX-Operator Juniper Execution Environment

This is a repo to build an Ansible Execution Environment that can communicate with Juniper devices using the `juniper.junos` roles as well as the `juniper.devices` collection.

it will work with the following `roles` or `collections` commands

`juniper.junos`
`Juniper.junos`
`juniper.device`

**Requirements**

You will need to have the following installed on the host machine in order to use this repo

- Docker
- Ansible-Builder
- An account on a container registration service (quay.io or docker hub for example)

The guide goes on the assumption that you have a basic understanding of `AWX-Operator` as well as `Ansible` and `Docker`.

# Steps to build the image for hosting

The following files need to be in the same folder

`bindep.txt`
`execution-environment.yml`
`requirements.txt`
`requirements.yml`

You will then need to run the `ansible-builder` script to compile the image. 

Things you will want to have ahead of time is information about your container registration and the names and tags you wish to use.

# Docker Hub Example

The following would be the process for uploading to the Docker Hub container registration repo

**Login to the repo**

You will need to login to your docker hub account so that you can push the image when complete. This will go on the example of `giuffrelab` as the account going forward. 

```
docker login
```

Enter your username and password.

**Building the Image**

run the following command to complie the image. the `-v 3` at the end is for the verbosity. If you do not care about this run it without it. Levels of verbosity are 1-3.

```
ansible-builder build --tag giuffrelab/awx-juniper-ee -v 3
```

**Upload the image to the container registry**

You should now have a new folder called context containing a Dockerfile and a _build folder. You can ignore these for now. 

you can verify your image or the name by running 

```
docker images
```

next you will need to upload the compiled image to Docker Hub. 

```
docker push giuffrelab/awx-juniper-ee
```

this will create your repo on your docker hub account for use

# Using the new Execution Environment in AWX-Operator

to make use of the new EE in AWX you need to do the following settings changes

**Add docker hub account**
